  "20": "Safeguarding adults (Level 2) Regulations CQC - Outcome 7 Learning outcomes Once you have completed this workbook you will:  Have an understanding of the background to adult safeguarding  Have some knowledge of national guidance and legislation  Be able to recognise different categories of abuse . Have an increased awareness of Mid Essex Hospital Trust (MEHT) adult safeguarding procedures and how to report concerns or actual abuse  Be able to identify indicators of abuse Guidance and legislation Everyone has a role to play in safeguarding vulnerable adults from abuse and ensuring they live a life free from it. Following the publication of 'No Secrets': guidance on developing and implementing multiagency policies and procedures to protect vulnerable adults from abuse (2000), procedures have been put in place locally to address adult safeguarding concerns. These are in the form of Southend Essex & Thurrock (SET) Safeguarding Adult Guidelines using multiagency procedures to safeguard vulnerable adults from abuse. For more information on 'No Secrets' (2000) please visit the Safeguarding Adult intranet page. Everyone has the right to live their life free from abuse and this right is underpinned by the duty on public agencies under the Human Rights Act (1998) to intervene proportionately to protect the rights of citizens. MEHT Safeguarding Adult policy encompasses the SET Guidelines following key concepts as part of the multiagency approach, including the Department of Health's document on Safeguarding Adults: The Role of Health Care Practitioners. Linking to empowerment, prevention, protection, proportionality, partnership and accountability. Our guidance and procedures are based on the principle that people should be enabled to make their own decisions about their lives and should be made aware of any choices and options available to help them make decisions. For more information on MEHT's Safeguarding Adult Policy please visit MEHT's Adult Safeguarding intranet page. Definition of a vulnerable adult A vulnerable adult is defined in No Secrets as a person aged 18 years or over, \"who is or may be in need of community care services by reason of mental or other disability, age or illness; and who is or may be unable to take care of him or herself, or unable to protect him or herself against significant harm or exploitation\". The person may have a:  Physical disability  Sensory impairment  Learning disability  Mental health problems  Age associated frailty illness or disability Significant harm is a key concept in adult safeguarding work and it helps to determine how serious or extensive abuse must be to justify intervention. In \"Who Decides\" (Lord Chancellor's Department 1997) significant harm is described as including \"not only ill treatment page 20 Your Mandatory Training Booklet | October 2014: First Edition ",
  "21": "(including sexual abuse and forms of ill treatment which are not physical), but also the impairment of, or an avoidable deterioration in, physical or mental health and the impairment of physical, intellectual, emotional, social or behavioural development\". Definition of abuse and categories of abuse Abuse is defined in No Secrets as \"a violation of an individual's human and civil rights by any other person or persons. Abuse may consist of a single act or repeated acts. It may be physical, verbal or psychological, it may be an act of neglect or an omission to act or it may occur when a vulnerable person is persuaded to enter into a financial or sexual transaction to which he or she has not consented, or cannot consent. Abuse can occur in any relationship and may result in significant harm to, or exploitation of, the person subjected to it\". There are seven categories of abuse outlined in the SET Guidance:  Physical abuse  Sexual abuse  Financial abuse  Neglect and acts of omission  Emotional abuse  Discriminatory abuse  Institutional abuse Domestic abuse, Honour Based Abuse, Forced Marriage and abuse by professionals are often described on their own as categories but although they are key components of safeguarding that we regularly have to deal with, they fall within the seven categories listed. For further guidance on the definitions and indicators of the categories of abuse refer to the MEHT Safeguarding Adult policy on the intranet Indicators of harm/abuse Although abuse often comes to light through disclosure by the person, who sensing they are safe, confides in a trusted person, there are situations or events that might indicate that all is not well. The following list highlights situations or events that may require closer attention. They are merely indicators, the presence of one or more does not confirm abuse and they are no substitute for a thorough assessment: Physical harm  Such as hitting, pushing, pinching, shaking, kicking, misusing medication, scalding, restraint, hair pulling  Unexplained injuries including fractures  Cluster of injuries forming regular patterns or  Reflecting shape of article  Lack of dignity in care  Rough handling Sexual harm Includes contact or non-contact  Non-contact: showing of pornography against a person's will, taking photographs of a sexual nature without consent  Contact: Inappropriate touching, rape or sexual acts without consent  Trafficking One of the newer elements of the safeguarding portfolio, human trafficking, is perhaps one of the most distressing, but one which we can truly provide positive support to as a multiagency partner. We can offer support to the wider prevention of human trafficking by working with the police and local authorities, to identify potential traffickers, while providing compassionate care, help, advice and understanding to Your Mandatory Training Booklet | October 2014: First Edition page 21 ",

Admission of trafficked people usually comes as a result of severe physical damage from violence, including sexual violence. There are known trafficking rings in the local community and you can play a vital role in supporting the police to prevent these serious crimes.

No one is allowed to harm a person based on race, sexuality, a person's disability or any other form of harassment or slurs . The Equality Act 2010 deemed there were nine protected characteristics - age; disability; gender reassignment; marriage and civil partnership; pregnancy and maternity; race; religion belief; sex; and sexual orientation. Institutional harm When people are mistreated due to poor or inadequate care, when they neglect and condone poor practice that affects the whole of that service they can be judged to have condoned institutional harm. This was found in:  Hospitals (Francis Report/Mid Staffs Enquiry)  Care Homes (Winterbourne View TV Programme (2012) that showed physical harm to adults with a learning disability) Risk factors There are many factors that could increase the risk of abuse, inclusive of below:  Dependency on others for assistance, especially with personal care and finances  Difficulty understanding certain decisions or transactions, decreased mobility and disability  Social isolation and lack of awareness regarding rights and complaints  Low self-esteem and lacking power in relationships Hate crimes page 22 Your Mandatory Training Booklet | October 2014: First Edition ",
  "23": " Limited life experience and sex education Indifference to the standard of care they are receiving  Lack of choice regarding accommodation and people they live withPerpetrators of abuse Abuse of vulnerable adults may be perpetrated by a wide range of people who are usually part of the service user's network and can include:  Relatives  Informal carers . Partners  Family members  Us: you and I, professional staff  Paid care workers  Volunteers, befrienders  Other service users  Neighbours  Friends and other associates Abuse of vulnerable adults does not have to be an outcome of a deliberate intent. Sometimes abuse happens when people are trying to do their best, and genuinely do not know they are doing the wrong thing. At times, the person who causes harm does so because of frustration even in the caring context. However, irrespective of why the abuse might happen, any abuse of a vulnerable adult is harmful. This makes it vitally important to ensure that those involved with the care and support of vulnerable adults have a clear sense of what signifies abuse and that abuse must be reported when suspected or discovered. What to do if abuse is suspected or disclosed  Take urgent action to protect the adult at risk from any immediate danger  Inform your line manager of concerns expressed Complete a datix incident form and page the CNS Adult Safeguarding on #6555 2508 . If further assessment is required by the safeguarding team you may also be asked to complete a safeguarding alert form (SET SAF 1) Please refer to MEHT's User Guide on How to report a safeguarding concern SET SAF 1's\\How to Report a Safeguarding Adult Concern.docx Preserving evidence When dealing with any allegation of abuse, due regard should be given as to whether or not the police should be involved and whether it is necessary to preserve evidence relating to the incident. Points for you to consider include:  Close off the room(s) until the police arrive to obtain forensic evidence  Rape or sexual assault victims to be advised not to change or wash clothes, consume drink/food or wash themselves  In financial abuse cases act quickly to report your concern as there may be some evidence e.g. CCTV footage and leave any documents alone, e.g. cheque books or bank books, so no one can touch them. When the person you are supporting talks to you about something abusive that has taken place, you must record and report that disclosure. The following are useful do's and don'ts to consider when dealing with disclosures: . Stay calm and try not to show shock or disbelief  Listen carefully, supporting this with appropriate non-verbal cues (nodding, open body posture, leaning forward etc.)  Be empathetic (I am sorry this has happened to you) . Let the person speak at their own pace, using their own words, don't jump in with a comment, judgement or correction Your Mandatory Training Booklet | October 2014: First Edition page 23 ",
  "24": " Record disclosure at earliest opportunity Do not ignore . Do not try and manage the situation on your own Do not promise to keep secrets . Do not contact/approach the alleged abuser unless advised . Do not sit on the information over the weekend until you are next on duty, etc. report immediately (site manager out- of-hours) . Do not assume others will act the responsibility lies with you Please remember to complete the datix incident form and a safeguarding alert. Sharing and storing of confidential information must be in line with data protection and Caldicott principles. Reporting abuse Referrals to the Safeguarding Adult Team should be made when there is a reason to believe that a vulnerable adult is at risk of being abused or is known to have been abused. The referral form that needs to be completed is called the Southend, Essex & Thurrock Safeguarding Alert Form (SET SAF 1). Please access the referral form via the intranet under adult safeguarding. Whistleblowing MEHT has a policy for whistleblowing. This policy provides the assurance of our organisation that paid and voluntary staff can raise concerns about the behaviour of others or about practice. MEHT are committed to the highest possible standard of operation, probity and accountability. In line with this commitment, employees and others with serious concerns about any aspect of their work are encouraged to come forward and voice those concerns via a Whistleblowing hotline. The whistleblowing policy has been designed to assist, encourage and enable employees to make serious concerns known. Staff who do not report concerns about the possible abuse of a vulnerable adult in accordance with the policy could be disciplined for not doing so, or for colluding with the abuse. Mental Capacity Act (2005) At times, difficulties could arise when people may lack capacity to make decisions some or all of the time. The Mental Capacity Act (2005) offers clarity on how we should respond in such situations in order to safeguard people who lack capacity and to offer information and support to people to make their own decisions. The Act is underpinned by five key principles:  A presumption of capacity . The right for individuals to be supported to make their own decisions . The right for individuals to make unwise decisions  Decisions made on behalf of people who lack capacity must be in their best interests  Best interest decisions should be least restrictive of their rights and freedoms For more information on the Mental Capacity Act (2005) please see the link below and access the MEHT MCA Policy via the MEHT intranet under Adult Safeguarding: www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/9/ contents At MEHT MCA1 forms are used for day to day decisions and MCA2 forms are used for significant medical treatments/decisions The way care is provided is being reformed and the term 'personalisation' is used to describe this change. The aim is to ensure page 24 Your Mandatory Training Booklet | October 2014: First Edition ",
  "25": "that people receiving care and support in every setting have choice and control over it. We recognise that choice involves risk and the emphasis is on how people and professionals work together to identify and manage that risk. The Dignity in Care campaign is about changing the culture of care and support services, putting dignity at the heart of all health and social care services through raising awareness and inspiring people to take action. For more information on the Dignity in Care campaign please see the link below: www.dignityincare.org.uk/ DignityCareCampaign/ Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLs) Sections 4A/4B and Schedules A1 and 1A MCA (2005). DoLs are only applicable to patients who lack capacity. The term DoLs is used frequently in the provision of healthcare, yet its definition, origin, need for understanding and reason for use in clinical practice are all very poorly understood by healthcare professionals on the whole. The Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards provide legal protection for those vulnerable people who are, or may become deprived of their liberty in a hospital, care home or domestic setting. The safeguards exist to provide a proper legal process and suitable protection in those circumstances where deprivation of liberty appears to be unavoidable, in a person's own best interests. The MCA/DoLS provide that deprivation of liberty:  Should be avoided whenever possible  Should only be authorised in cases where it is in the relevant person's best interests and the only way to keep them safe . The Acid Test must be applied . Should be for as short a time as possible DoLS is a complex area of law and so if you have a concern that a patient is being deprived of their liberty please contact the Elderly Assessment Team (EAT) or the CNS Adult Safeguarding for support. Please refer to the MEHT DoLS Policy on the adult safeguarding intranet page for support on the procedures at MEHT. MCA/ DoLS training is provided bi-weekly for all staff. Restraint: section 6(4) Mental Capacity Act (2005) Restraint alone does not constitute a deprivation of a person's liberty. However, this cannot be interpreted as meaning that patients can be restrained without due consideration of the lawfulness of such measures being taken. Restraint of a person who has capacity by clinical staff in the course of their duties is considered common assault. While restraint of a person in clinical practice, who lacks capacity may be permitted, it is only lawful if the restraint is applied under specific conditions and with due consideration being given to key underlying principles. Section 6(4) The MCA (2005) states that someone is using restraint if they: . Use force or threaten to use force to make someone do something they are resisting or  Restrict a person's freedom of movement, whether they are resisting or not, this could be by using chemical restraint (sedation) Your Mandatory Training Booklet | October 2014: First Edition page 25 ",
  "26": "NB: This highlights the significance of restraint management in clinical practice settings and the need to ensure that our actions are lawful, applying MCA principles in the execution of our duties in caring for patients who lack capacity. There is a restraint policy which staff must adhere to and they should contact the Policy Lead or EAT/Safeguarding when concerns arise about the need to restrain a patient who lacks capacity as part of their care (therapeutic restraint). Prevent In June 2011, the Prevent Strategy was presented to Parliament by the Secretary of State for the Home Department. Prevent is part of the Government's counter-terrorism strategy Contest and its aim is to stop people becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism. Both are part of a legal framework, part of which needs to be integrated into the workplace by NHS healthcare providers. One of the key objectives of the Prevent Strategy is to work with sectors and institutions where there are risks of radicalisation which need to be addressed. The need for NHS providers to engage with the Prevent Strategy is two-fold: 1. The NHS is one of the biggest employers in the UK and therefore integrating the Prevent Strategy across health will ensure its implementation is widespread throughout the country. or 2. Frontline staff working in health may, in the course of carrying out their duties, come into contact with people, who may exhibit signs or behaviours of extremist activity. All staff need to be alert and act on concerns of radicalisation. MEHT's Prevent Lead is the Local Security Management Specialist; please contact the lead with any concerns and these can be discussed and shared. Specialist training is provided to key staff and departments via Conflict Resolution training. Safeguarding adults  S: Suspect harm?

This briefing is for the purpose of updating Mid Essex Hospital Services NHS Trust staff only. To become fully compliant with Level two training you are required to read the written briefing and complete the attached quiz and return to the Training and Development department. Level two safeguarding children training is required for \"All non-clinical and clinical staff who have any contact with children, young people and/or parents/carers\" Safeguarding children and young people: roles and competences for health care staff: Intercollegiate Document, March 2014. The purpose of this briefing is to support you in understanding what is meant by Safeguarding Children and Child protection, the different ways a child or young person may be abused or neglected and what actions you should take if you have concerns that a child is being harmed. Please be aware that \"doing nothing is not an option\". Introduction Mid Essex Hospital Services NHS Trust (MEHT) is committed to Safeguarding Children and Young People. It is required to fulfil its statutory duty under Working Together to Safeguard Children 2013 and Section 11 of the Children Act 2004 in order to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. The Children Act 1989 defines a child as \"anyone who has not yet reached their 18th birthday\" The fact that a child has become 16 years of age, is living independently, is in further education, a member of the armed services, is in hospital or in custody in the secure estate for children and young people does not change his or her status or entitlement to services or protection. All children deserve the opportunity to achieve their full potential; the sooner the need for additional support is identified the better the outcomes for children. Safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children is defined as:  Protecting children from maltreatment  Preventing impairment of children's health or development  Ensuring children are growing up in circumstances consistent with the provision of safe and effective care  Taking action to enable all children to have the best outcomes. This was historically framed around the \"Every Child matters\" agenda which identified that there are five key outcomes which support children and young people to achieve their full potential namely:  Stay Safe  Be Healthy  Enjoy and achieve  Make a positive contribution  Achieve economic wellbeing Effective safeguarding is underpinned by two key principles:  Safeguarding is everyone's responsibility; for services to be effective each professional and each organisation should play their full part.  A child centred approach; for services to be effective they should be based on a clear understanding of the needs and views of children Working Together to Safeguard Children, 2013 Your Mandatory Training Booklet | October 2014: First Edition page 29 ",
  "30": "Key definitions Child protection is a part of safeguarding and promoting welfare. It refers to the activity that is undertaken to protect specific children who are being abused, those who are suffering, or are likely to suffer, significant harm. Child in Need is defined as being \"in need\" when the child is unlikely to reach or maintain a satisfactory level of health and development or it will be significantly impaired without the provision of services. Significant harm is the threshold that justifies compulsory intervention in family life in the best interests of the child and gives local authorities a duty to make enquiries. There are no absolute criteria for identifying significant harm and it will depend on the:  Degree and extent of physical harm . Duration and frequency of the abuse or neglect Extent of premeditation . Degree of threat and coercion It must be acknowledged that Child protection work \"involves uncertainty we cannot know for sure what is going on in the privacy of family life nor can we predict with certainty what will happen\" Munro, 2012 Principles of the Children Act 1989 and 2004 Children Act 1989 The Children Act 1989 is the main piece of legislation that underpins our child protection work. This act introduced a number of principles: . The child's welfare must come first. Racial, cultural, religious and linguistic needs should be taken into account.  Parental responsibility (see below).  Professionals and families must work together for the welfare of the child. . The voice of the child; Children's wishes and feelings should be ascertained so that they can contribute appropriately to the situation.  A child's own family is the best place for a child to be brought up whenever possible; if the parents are unable to meet the needs of the child then a family member who is deemed suitable will be allowed to care for that child.  A court should not make an order unless it is needed to improve the child's life.  Children must be protected from serious harm. The local authority has a duty to investigate any reports that a child is suffering, or likely to suffer, significant harm (section 47)  Services necessary to safeguard and promote the welfare of children (in need) should be provided to support families who may be in need of such services The welfare and safety of the child are always paramount and the rights of children will always come above the rights of any adult. Therefore we must always share appropriate and relevant information relating to children in order to maintain their safety. The Data Protection Act 1998 is not a barrier to sharing this information but a tool to support the process, even if the needs of an adult are such that they are vulnerable themselves. Parental responsibility . Birth mothers automatically have parental responsibility for their children. This means that they can make decisions about them but also are responsible for making sure their children are looked after.  Birth fathers who are (or were) married to the child's mother at the time of child's birth will also have parental responsibility. page 30 Your Mandatory Training Booklet | October 2014: First Edition ",
  "31": " After 1 December 2003 both of a child's legal parents will have parental responsibility if registered on the birth certificate. . Pre this date birth fathers could acquire parental responsibility either by the mother agreeing to this formally or by applying for a court order if they were not married.  In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, parental responsibilities may be exercised until a young person reaches 18 years.  Any adult with parental responsibility (PR) is also legally able to consent to treatment for the child. Parental responsibility can be acquired by:  Legal guardians or other adults where this has been awarded in a court order . The local authority (at the point a child is taken into care) Foster carers do not have parental responsibility. Further information and guidance can be found in the MEHT Consent Policy. Children Act 2004 The Children Act 2004 came into force following the death of Victoria Climbie. This Act introduced the following principles:  Early help/intervention  Private fostering A private fostering arrangement is defined as: 'an arrangement between families/ households, without the involvement of a local authority, for the care of a child under the age of 16 (under 18 if disabled) by someone other than a parent or close relative; close relatives are identified as parents, step-parents, siblings, siblings of a parent and grandparents for 28 days or more. This could be an arrangement by mutual agreement between parents and the carers or the young person may have chosen to leave the family home against the parents' wishes to live with a friend a situation where a child has left home against their parent's wishes and is living with a friend and their family. The period for which the child is cared for and accommodated by the private foster carer should be continuous, but that continuity is not broken by the occasional short break. If you are aware that a child is in a private fostering arrangement you must contact social care as they will arrange to check the carers are suitable. Child abuse and neglect Abuse and neglect are forms of maltreatment of a child or young person. The term child abuse describes a range of ways in which people harm children or young people knowingly, or by failing to act to prevent harm. Children may be abused in a family or in an institutional or community setting, by those known to them or, more rarely, by a stranger for example, via the internet. They may be abused by an adult or adults, or another child or children. Child abuse can be:  Physical  Emotional  Sexual  Neglect Your Mandatory Training Booklet | October 2014: First Edition page 31 ",
  "32": "In many cases, children are subjected to a combination of types of abuse e.g. neglect and emotional abuse. Some forms of abuse are easier to identify than others such as when a child is physically harmed but other abuse is more subtle such as in emotional abuse. While some types of abuse are caused by someone doing something that harms the child, others are the result of neglect, of failing to take steps to keep children safe and well. Definitions of abuse Physical abuse This is defined as: Hitting, shaking, throwing, poisoning, burning or scalding, drowning, suffocating or otherwise causing physical harm to a child It also includes Fabricated or induced illness (FII) previously known as Munchausen's syndrome by Proxy; this is where a parent or carers feigns the symptoms of, or deliberately causes ill health to a child whom they are looking after. There are three main ways that this may occur  Fabrication of signs and symptoms; this may include fabrication of past medical history  Fabrication of signs and symptoms and falsification of hospital charts and records and specimens of bodily fluids. It may also include the falsification of letters and documents  Induction of illness by a variety of means. Emotional abuse This is defined as: The persistent emotional ill treatment of a child that causes severe and persistent adverse effects on the child's emotional development. It may involve: . Conveying to the child that they are worthless or unloved, inadequate, or valued only insofar as they meet the needs of another person. . Not allowing the child to express their views, deliberately silencing them or 'making fun' of what they say or how they communicate.  Imposition of inappropriate age or developmental expectations; this may include interactions that are beyond the child's developmental capability, as well as overprotection and limitation of exploration and learning, or preventing the child participating in normal social interaction.  Conveying a low sense of self worth.  Causing a child to feel frightened frequently such as bullying.  Exploitation or corruption of a child. Some level of emotional abuse is involved in all types of maltreatment of a child, though it may occur alone. It may also involve seeing or hearing the ill- treatment of another as in Domestic Abuse (Children and Adoption Act 2002) Domestic abuse is defined by the Home office (2009) as: page 32 Your Mandatory Training Booklet | October 2014: First Edition ",
  "33": "\"Any incident of threatening behaviour, violence or abuse (psychological, physical, sexual, financial or emotional) between adults who are or have been intimate partners or family members, regardless of gender or sexuality\"; this has now been extended to include young people aged 16-18 who are in an intimate relationship. Domestic Abuse now includes Honour Based abuse, Forced Marriage and Female Genital Mutilation Controlling behaviour is: a range of acts designed to make a person subordinate and/or dependent by isolating them from sources of support, exploiting their resources and capacities for personal gain, depriving them of the means needed for independence, resistance and escape and regulating their everyday behaviour. Coercive behaviour is: an act or a pattern of acts of assault, threats, humiliation and intimidation or other abuse that is used to harm, punish, or frighten their victim. Risk and impact domestic violence has on children Children living with domestic violence (DV) and abuse can be adversely affected and the impact is usually on every aspect of a child's life. The impact of domestic violence and abuse on an individual child will vary according to the child's resilience and the strengths and weaknesses of their particular circumstances. . 90% of cases with children in same/ next room . About half the children in DV families have themselves been badly hit or beaten  75% of children subject to a child protection plan live in households with DV  90% of child deaths through abuse feature domestic violence The impact includes:  Children may get caught in the 'cross fire' protecting their mother and sustain physical injuries  Girls often seek to protect siblings during episodes of violence  Depression, anxiety, guilt, fear, insecurity, sleeping and eating disorders, nightmares, shame, self- harming  Difficulties with concentration, heightened aggression, violence as 'normal', early sexual and/or drug activity, disobedience/anti-social behaviour (boys) In the event Domestic abuse is suspected and it is known that there are children in the family a referral to social care is required. Honour Based abuse occurs when a person is considered to bring dishonour to their family or community; this can lead to the assault, imprisonment or murder of the individual. Forced Marriage occurs where one or both parties do not want to (or in the case of people with a learning disability cannot) consent to the marriage and pressure or abuse is used. A person who is known to be lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender may be at greater risk. It has been illegal within the UK since June 2014. This is not the same as an arranged marriage as within this arrangement the consent of both individuals is given. Female Genital mutilation is also illegal in the UK; it continues to be practiced in a number of countries such as in Africa, Middle East and Asia. It is a reportable incident within the Trust via Datix, a referral to social care will be required if there are female children in the family. Your Mandatory Training Booklet | October 2014: First Edition page 33 ",
  "34": "Sexual abuse This involves forcing or enticing a child to take part in sexual activities, whether or not the child is aware of what is happening. It must be noted that women and children can also sexually abuse children. Sexual abuse can involve;  physical contact such as in penetration (rape or oral sex) or non-penetration (masturbation, kissing, rubbing or touching over clothing).  non-physical contact such as involving children in looking at, or in the production of sexual images, watching sexual activities, encouraging a child to behave in sexually inappropriate ways or grooming a child in preparation for abuse (including via the internet) It also includes Child sexual exploitation which is defined as: \"Sexual exploitation of children and young people involves exploitative situations, contexts and relationships where young people receive something (food, accommodation, gifts, alcohol, drugs, affection, money) as a result of them performing or others performing on them, sexual activities\". Neglect Neglect is the persistent failure to meet a child's basic physical and/or psychological needs, likely to result in the serious impairment of the child's health or development. Neglect may occur during pregnancy as a result of maternal substance abuse. Once a child is born, neglect may involve a parent or carer failing to:  Provide adequate food, clothing and shelter (including exclusion from home or abandonment)  Protect a child from physical and emotional harm or danger  Ensure adequate supervision (including the use of inadequate care-givers); or  Ensure access to appropriate medical care or treatment It may also include neglect of, or unresponsiveness to, a child's basic emotional needs. Working Together to Safeguard Children 2013 What are the effects of child abuse? The effects of cruelty to children are wide- ranging and profound. They vary according to the type of abuse and how long it has been endured but can include:  Behavioural problems  Educational problems  Mental health problems  Relationship difficulties  Drug and alcohol problems  Suicide or other self-harm  Injury and in extreme cases, death It is therefore imperative to identify and act on any concerns immediately. MEHT staff must inform the local authority of any child who is at risk of significant harm on the same day; this is likely to be verbal and must be followed up in writing using the inter-agency referral form. The Local authority has a duty to investigate all child protection referrals.

Exploitation includes: . The prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation  Forced labour or services  Slavery  Servitude  Removal of organs Trafficking does not only occur from country to country but may occur within the country of origin; the vulnerable person may be removed from their home town and be relocated to somewhere else within the country. If you have concerns: Consider: . Does the child present with an adult and if so do you have reason to doubt the relationship? . Does the child come from another country? . Does the child appear scared or cautious of the adult they are with? . Do you think the child or young person could be withholding information or telling you a rehearsed story? Please note: In any case where English is not the first language always use an official interpreter, family members and friends are not to be used. Many survivors comment that the emotional consequences are far more severe than the physical effects of abuse. Fortunately, children who are abused can be helped. What is vital is that everyone who works with children, whether in a paid or voluntary capacity are equipped to recognise signs of child abuse at the earliest opportunity so that the harm can be stopped and the damage can start to be repaired.

These children do not have or need a lead professional; the parents/carers successfully take on this role. Additional Children and their families who have additional and/or vulnerable needs that go beyond what is on offer from universal services are supported by targeted services.

  "38": "Intensive Some families will at some time have the need for a targeted service. Some may need a very specific intervention to meet a specific need, delivered by a single service whilst others may have complex needs. If you have a family with complex needs then Family solutions may have a role. This service will undertake an assessment with the family and match a worker who works with the family for up to 12 months. Please refer to the safeguarding team for further advice on this service. Links to the website are provided on the Intranet. To access this service there must be written consent from the parent and all family members 16 years old and over if they wish to be part of the assessment; the form requesting a Shared Family assessment in available on the intranet; this replaces the Common Assessment Framework (CAF). Specialist Specialist services are required where the needs of the child and their family are so great that intensive or complex intervention is required to keep them safe or to ensure their continued development. Specialist services often have a statutory element to them, meaning that either the child or family are statutorily obliged to engage with the service or that the NHS or local authorities are statutorily obliged to provide it, or both. Examples of specialist services include statutory children's social care interventions (child in need, child protection or Look After Children Service), statutory youth offending service work, services provided for children and young people as a result of statements of special education need and services provided for children and young people with complex mental health needs and/or substance misuse dependency. In these cases, a person from the service providing the statutory intervention will act as the lead professional. If you do need to make a referral to Social care If a child is considered to be a 'child in need' or a 'child in need of protection as defined by the Children Act 1989, a referral should be made to children's social care. If you are unsure please speak to a member of the safeguarding children team. Please note parental consent is not required if the child is in need of protection. It is good practice to advise the parents that you are making a referral to social care unless: . You are concerned about risk of further harm to the child or children . You are concerned about the risk to you or your colleagues . There may be loss of evidential material There must be no delay in making the referral and it should be made before the end of your shift/working day. In an emergency, the referral can be made over the telephone but must then be confirmed in writing on the inter-agency referral form within 48 hours. Any child who will be in hospital for more than three months must be referred, under section 85 of the Children Act 1989, to children's social care team. The referral should be made as soon as it is anticipated that the child will be in hospital long term. If there are concerns about the safety and welfare of a child/young person who is currently an in-patient or who has presented at the Accident and Emergency Department (A&E), they must not be discharged until the assurance is provided that there is an agreed plan in place that will safeguard the childs welfare. If you have reason to believe that a child is in imminent danger of harm the police should be called using the 999 emergency services number. page 38 Your Mandatory Training Booklet | October 2014: First Edition ",

Social care will acknowledge the referral; if you have not heard from social care then the person making the referral should contact social care for an update. They may advise: . No further action / Provision of advice and information  Further assessment required  Emergency action to protect the child/ children . Police involvement if crime committed  Section 47 enquiries can be initiated at any time. In some circumstances it may be that it is unsuitable for a child to be discharged into the care of the parents. If a police protection order is required this will last for 72 hours until reports can be completed if it requires court intervention. Social Care and other professionals will discuss the next steps with the family and agree the plan for discharge if the child is an in-patient.

"16": "Clinical Record Keeping What is record keeping? Good record keeping is an integral part of every healthcare professionals practice and is essential to the provision of safe and effective care. It is not an optional extra to be fitted in if circumstances allow. (NMC, 2009 GMC Good Medical Practice 2013/ Confidentiality 2009). The code standards of conduct, performance and ethics for clinicians  You must keep clear and accurate records of the discussions you have, the assessments you make, the treatment and medicines you give.  You must complete records as soon as possible after an event has occurred.  You must not tamper with original records in any way.  You must ensure any entries you make in someone's paper records are clearly and legibly signed, dated and timed.  You must ensure any entries you make in someone's electronic records are clearly attributable to you. . You must ensure all records are kept securely (NMC 2008, GMC Good Medical Practice 2013/ Confidentiality 2009). Why is record keeping important? Record keeping is part of the professional 'duty of care' owed by the clinician to the patient. Failure therefore to maintain reasonable standards of record keeping could be evidence of professional misconduct and subject to professional conduct proceedings. Who can document? Record keeping can be delegated to healthcare assistants (HCAs), assistant practitioners (APs) and student nurses or student doctors so that they can document the care they provide. As with any delegated activity, the registered nurse, midwife or doctor needs to ensure that the student or HCA/AP is competent to undertake the task and that it is in the patient's best interests for record keeping to be delegated. Supervision and a countersignature are required until the student/HCA/AP is deemed competent at keeping records. Registered nurses should only countersign if they have witnessed the activity or can validate that it took place. Organisations providing healthcare should supply clear guidance on record keeping for all staff, in line with the principles and guidance in the NMC's record keeping guidance. Good record keeping  Helps to improve accountability  Shows how decisions related to patient care were made  Supports the delivery of services  Supports effective clinical judgements and decisions Supports patient care and communications  Makes continuity of care easier  Provides documentary evidence of services delivered  Promotes better communication and sharing of information between members of the multi-professional healthcare team  Helps to identify risks and enables early detection of complications  Supports clinical audit, research, allocation of resources and page 16 Your Mandatory Training Booklet | October 2014: First Edition ",
